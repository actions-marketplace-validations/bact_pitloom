"""No wall-clock read reaches the output except as the last fallback.

Output must be byte-identical across runs once a datetime is pinned
(``--creation-datetime``, ``[tool.pitloom] creation-datetime`` or
``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH``). A wall-clock read is allowed only where it is the
last step of that cascade, listed below with its reason. A new one -- such
as the enrichment ``CreationInfo`` that once read the clock directly, and
made two runs a second apart differ -- fails here: route it through the
pinned value instead, or add it with the reason it cannot leak.
