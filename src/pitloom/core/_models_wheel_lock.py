"""Reader/writer concurrency lock for backend file discovery.

Split out of :mod:`pitloom.core._models_wheel_dispatch` once that file
(and its sibling :mod:`pitloom.core._models_wheel`) crossed the
~400-500 line soft limit -- a self-contained concurrency primitive with
no dependency on the dispatch logic that uses it.

See also: :mod:`pitloom.core._models_wheel_dispatch`, the sole caller.

class _DiscoveryLock:
    """Multiple concurrent readers, or one exclusive writer -- never both.
    Writer-priority: once a writer is waiting, no *new* reader is admitted
    ahead of it, so a continuous stream of freshly-arriving readers can
    never starve a writer out indefinitely -- it only ever waits for
    readers already in flight at the moment it arrived.

    A "writer" (a backend registered with ``needs_write_lock=True`` in
    :class:`pitloom.core._models_wheel_dispatch._RegisteredBackend` --
    currently setuptools and PDM-backend) process-wide ``os.chdir()``s
    for the duration of its call and must run with no other discoverer
    -- reader or writer -- active. A "reader" (every other backend, e.g.
    Hatchling's, Poetry's, or Flit's ``discover()``) never touches cwd
    itself (``get_wheel_files`` always resolves *project_dir* to an
    absolute path first), so readers never need to block each other --
    only a concurrent writer. Held here, at the sole dispatch point
    every backend's ``discover()`` funnels through, so a future backend
    module needs no lock of its own to get the same guarantee; a future
    *writer*-style backend should register with ``needs_write_lock=True``
    the same way setuptools/PDM-backend do.

    Deliberate exception: the generic build-and-read mechanism
    (:mod:`pitloom.core._models_wheel_build_and_read`, invoked via
    ``--allow-build``) does NOT go through this lock at all, in either
    mode -- it provably touches no process-wide mutable state (the real
    build runs in a subprocess with its own explicit ``cwd=``, never
    Pitloom's own), so it needs neither a reader's nor a writer's
    guarantee. It is also categorically slower (network, venv creation,
    a real build -- seconds to tens of seconds) than every in-process
    backend here; holding even a read lock around it would block a
    concurrent writer for the entire build duration, a large, surprising
    latency coupling with no actual state to protect. See
    ``_try_build_and_read`` in :mod:`pitloom.core._models_wheel_dispatch`,
    which calls it unguarded.

    Both ``read()`` and ``write()`` guard against re-entrant acquisition
    by the thread already holding the write lock: a writer backend's own
    ``discover()`` (setuptools imports the target project's ``setup.py``,
    PDM-backend runs the project's own build hooks -- both arbitrary
    third-party code) that calls back into file discovery -- through
    *either* a reader backend (Hatchling, Poetry, Flit) or another
    writer -- while already holding the write lock would otherwise
    deadlock against itself, since only that same thread could ever
    release it. Both methods raise ``RuntimeError`` immediately instead.
    (The build-and-read mechanism above is a separate matter: it never
    holds this lock in the first place, so it cannot trigger this case.)
